== About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Transportation Systems Analysis and Planning at [https://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University]. Working with [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/nie-yu.html Prof. Marco Nie], I specialize in the analysis of emerging urban mobility systems, such as ridesourcing, bikesharing, and co-modality systems, with tools drawing from economics, optimization, and operations research. Prior to joining Northwestern, I obtained an M.S. degree (with honor) in Transportation and a B.E. degree in Civil Engineering, both from Zhejiang University, China.
