== About me
I am an Assistant Professor in the Departments of [https://ise.utk.edu/ Industrial and Systems Engineering] and [https://cee.utk.edu/ Civil and Environmental Engineering] (by courtesy). I direct the Electrified, Autonomous, and Shared Transportation (EAST) Lab at [https://www.utk.edu/ University of Tennessee, Knoxville] (UTK). 

Prior to joining UTK, I received my Ph.D. degree in Transportation Systems Analysis and Planning from [https://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University], working with [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/nie-yu.html Prof. Marco Nie]. I also hold an M.S. degree in Transportation and a B.E. degree in Civil Engineering, both from Zhejiang University, China.


My research centers on the crosscutting field of Industrial Engineering and Mobility. Methodology-wise, I specialize in developing novel tools based on *transportation economics*, *game theory*, *machine learning (ML)*, *optimization*, and *network modeling*. Key areas of my research include, but are not limited to:

- Data-driven modeling for dynamic systems;
- Design and regulation of shared mobility services;
- Autonomous mobility systems;
- Transportation sustainability and equity;
- Smart logistics.

Findings from my research have been published in /Transportation Science, Transportation Research Part A, B, and C/.

*My lab is recruiting one fully funded Ph.D. student starting 2025 Fall/2026 Spring. [doc/2025_2026_PhD_Recuiting_Zheng \[Link\]]*

I am also happy to host (remote) undergraduate/graduate visitors. Interested students, please email me with your CV, availability, and research interests (could be either broad or specific).
