<div class="blocktitle">Network-Wide Traffic State Estimation and Prediction with DiDi's Massive Probe Vehicle Trajectory Data: A Deep Learning Approach, funded by Didi Chuxing</div>
<div class="blockcontent">
<ul>
<li><p>Charged of writing project proposal, forged the independently-proposal-writing ability and skills</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed a new deep learning framework for network-wide traffic state estimation and prediction, short and long term, via intrinsic traffic information(e.g., DiDi's massive vehicle trajectory data) and extrinsic variables (e.g., road topology information, and special events)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposed the methodology to estimate the ground truth of traffic states by sampling low-percentage connected vehicles&rsquo; trajectory data through simulation tools</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blocktitle">Demand/Supply Evolutionary Mechanism and Control Strategies Optimization for On-Demand Ride Services Based on Connected Mobile Big Data, funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China</div>
<div class="blockcontent">
<ul>
<li><p>Customized a model to delineate the dynamic passenger-and-driver meeting process in on-demand ride service market; unlike historical equilibrium models, this model contributes to characterizing the influence of the short-term variances and disturbances of instant demand and supply</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposed different goals of dynamic pricing, e.g., platform profit and social welfare; used approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to solve the multi-period decision problem</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transformed the ride-sourcing dispatching problem into a searching tree structure; adopted Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to solve the problem, proving that MCTS embraces a better rapidity for near-optimal solutions searching, compared with the benchmark algorithms, i.e., greedy search, brute force search, branch and bound</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blocktitle">Travel Demand Forecasting of On-Demand Ride Services Based on Deep Learning, funded by Ministry of Education of China</div>
<div class="blockcontent">
<ul>
<li><p>Explored a short-term travel demand forecasting model (long short-term memory neural network) with real-world on-demand data of a large-scale urban network on the basis of scientific division of traffic analysis zone (TAZ)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Developed different short-term traffic speed prediction models that consider spatial and temporal parameters based on random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR); calibrated the models using one-year traffic data extracted from PeMS, obtained by web crawlers</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blocktitle">Transportation Big Data Analysis, funded by Didi Chuxing</div>
<div class="blockcontent">
<ul>
<li><p>Processed massive DiDi's order data and visualize the temporal and spatial distribution of data</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explored on-demand ridesplitting users&rsquo; travel habits and individual transportation modal shift behavior, given the unavailability of ridesplitting services, based on online survey data</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quantitatively calculated ridesplitting's influence on vehicle use and purchase willingness, with reference to a case study in Hangzhou, China</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blocktitle">Real-time Traffic Situation Identification via Internet Data Fusion, funded by Research Center of ITS Engineering and Technologies of Zhejiang</div>
<div class="blockcontent">
<ul>
<li><p>Independently programmed web crawlers in python; collected one-year Hangzhou real-time traffic data from Baidu map open Application Programming Interface (API)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Processed both raw loop and camera data; analyzed the advantages of detector and internet traffic data; drew virtual trajectory lines using space-time velocity field to estimate travel time</p>
</li>

<p><b>Served as a graduate research assistant with <a href="http://cehyang.people.ust.hk" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Hai Yang</a> (PI)</b></p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blocktitle">Understanding Behavior of Drivers and Passengers in On-Demand Ride Service Markets, funded by Didi Chuxing</div>
<div class="blockcontent">
<ul>
<li><p>Explored the application of deep learning in spatio-temporal demand prediction; indexed the hexagon calculation units into a sequence based on TAZ and adapted long short-term memory neural network to solve the incomptability between the hexagons in DiDi system and the convolutional neural network, a deep learning approach mostly used for image recognition</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposed to introduce the area inflow and outflow of cars as features in the prediction model so as to improve the prediction accuracy by 3%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Analyzed the express and taxi service market in DiDi by using data-driven method; observed that regional demand increases parallelly with the positive linear correlation of the demand for express and taxi, and the decrease of regional demand synchronizes with insignificant correlation</p>
</li>
